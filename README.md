# NeoVim configs

This is where I store my [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) configurations and used
plugins. I use them on Linux and Mac, things may break for you, let me know if
something need fixing.

This configurations won't work on regular Vim mostly because of the file naming
(``init.vim`` vs ``.vimrc``) but most of the configurations and code will, so
if you want you can copy/paste most of this.

I have not used this on Vim for quite a while and I've used specifics for
Neovim without caring for compatibility with Vim, so most likely this would
break when used on non-Neovim.
